# Sponsoring

Following our passion to connect web workers in RheinMain is the key driver why we're doing all this in our free time. 
But also - to create and support high quality tech events for developers - some support by helpful companies is important.
And we have a lot more plans for the future. Therefore we need sponsoring partners.

There are many options to support our work and many benefits you will receive back:

- Awareness of your brand: Our community members recognize you as a nmodern and open company supporting the local tech community
- Find new colleagues: Through job postings and the possibility to host meetups at your location, your company reaches experts directly
- Your employees profit from the knowledge transfer in our events (and can take part, too)

Please ask for our sponsoring packages. [We're happy to talk with you!](contact.html)
