# Sponsoring

Following our passion to connect web workers in RheinMain is the key driver why we're doing all this in our free time. 
But also - to create and support high quality tech events for developers - some support by helpful companies is important.

## Main sponsor for 2020 needed!

::: tip

Currently, as of beginning of 2020, we are desperately in need of a new main sponsor which would cover:

- One-time costs (amount tbd):
  - A video-camera plus accessories (audio transmitter, cables etc.) so that
we are able to record (or even stream) talks in a best quality and provide them on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYFNj1jr1ZufRZLlPDVGYIw)
  - Software licenses for Adobe Premiere & After Effects (preferred) 
- Regular costs (~30 EUR monthly): This includes ongoing marketing stuff (stickers and t-shirts (planned) and domain- and
other fees

Your advantages:

- You will be featured on our
  - homepage
  - [meetup-group](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/frontend_rm/) (450+ members)
  - [twitter profile](https://twitter.com/frontend_rm) (500+ follower)
  - newsletter (planned)
- Your company name is presented in all our future [videos](http://localhost:8080/ferm/videos.html) (we plan to update the style of the current video style a bit,
so that your logo will not only be seen at the end like [here](https://youtu.be/NAsSNMczRvQ?t=2726))
- You can strengthen (or even start) your community-engagement image in RheinMain: Helping web workers to connect themselves
and connect with them when you're seeking new colleagues.
- We gained some reputation since 2014 in our region and your company can hook up to the web worker scene

And, psssst ... 

::: warning

- We're creating a new 2-days event format this year and the new Frontend RheinMain main sponsor gets a "prime seat" in terms of sponsoring

## Wanna offer your location?

Supporting our community work is easy and just starts by [contacting us](contact.html). We're always seeking nice locations for the various meetups.
Basically we just need a bit to drink and eat, tech setup (beamer, wifi ...) and space for 30-80 people.

## Benefits for your company

Sponsoring our meetups is a budget-friendly and highly effective way for your company to find new colleagues. As an event host:

::: tip
- You get the stage before the main talk(s) to present your company including your open positions and spread some merchandise
- You offer room to connect with and directly approach like-minded people /  potential new colleagues
- You can hear which cutting-edge topics are currently being discussed in the community 
- Potential new staff members can see your location from the inside at a glance
