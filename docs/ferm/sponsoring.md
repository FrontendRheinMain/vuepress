## Benefits for your company

::: tip

Sponsoring our meetups is an budget-friendly and highly effective way for your company to find new colleagues. As an event host:

- you have the stage before the main talk(s) to present your company incl. your open positions and spread some merchandise
- you offer room to connect with and directly approach like-minded people /  potential new colleagues
- you can hear which cutting-edge topics are currently being discussed in the community 
- potential new staff members can see your location from the inside at a glance
