# Our mission: Pushing knowledge transfer and connecting webworkers in RheinMain

Frontend RheinMain is a community-hub for frontend devs and friends in the RheinMain area, supporting local tech meetups and organizers. 

# What we do

## Support meetup initiatives

... by: 

- helping you organize your meetup with our team
- referring interesting speakers to your meetup  
- featuring your event on our homepage before and cover it afterwards
- actively promoting your event on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/frontend_rm)
- recording your talks on [video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYFNj1jr1ZufRZLlPDVGYIw)
- occasionally hand-out benefits for your participants like cheap or free conference tickets, coupon codes, books etc.

## Organize tech events

Few times a year we also organize free frontend meetups by ourselves in Frankfurt, Wiesbaden, Mainz and Darmstadt - sponsored by helpful companies supplying room, wifi, beamer, drinks and food. This engages a cozy atmosphere to connect with other webworkers, to learn new stuff and get inspired by latest developments in our frontend field.

## Recruiting-support for companies

Sponsoring our meetups is a budget-friendly and highly effective way for your company to find new colleagues. As an event host:

- you have the stage before the main talk(s) to present your company incl. your open positions and spread some merchandise
- you offer room to connect with and directly approach like-minded people /  potential new colleagues
- you can hear which cutting-edge topics are currently being discussed in the community 
- potential new staff members can see your location from the inside at a glance

## Expand reach for publishers

You are a publisher and/or conference organizer? Either if you want to expand your reach to promote your conference or if you just released e.g. new books covering web development topics, there's a win-win-situation for both of us: When you send us a goodie for one of our meetups you get lots of positive attention from our community-members and enable us to add even more attraction to our meetups - because nerds always like cool goodies.
